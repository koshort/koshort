"Social network services and other internet communities are open and rich "
"data source of human spoken language. But due to the issues of privacy "
"and policy of each website, sharing a bunch of retrieved text data is "
"normally prohibited. To solve the most major Natural Language Processing "
"(NLP) problem under this circumstances, researchers had to rely on "
"limited public datasets and data brought by their company. Otherwise they"
" would implement their domain-specific crawler for each case."
